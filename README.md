Hangman Game (C++ Project):

This is a console-based Hangman Game implemented in C++.  
The program randomly selects a word and allows the user to guess it within limited attempts.  
It uses fundamental programming concepts including:

- Arrays  
- Loops  
- Random number generation  
- String comparison  
- Conditional logic  
- User input handling  

Features:

-> Random word selection  
-> 6 attempts limit  
-> Option to guess full word  
-> Displays progress with “– – –” placeholders  
-> Simple and easy-to-understand logic  
-> Fully console-based  

Concepts Used:

- `rand()` and `srand()` for random word choice  
- Array manipulation  
- `strcmp()` for string comparison  
- Character-by-character matching  
- Nested loops  
- Conditional checks  
- Basic game-flow management  

How to Play:

1. The program displays blanks for a randomly selected word.  
2. You guess one letter at a time.  
3. You have 6 attempts.  
4. If you press `$`, you can skip guessing and enter the full word.  
5. You win if the word matches!

Notes:

- The word bank is small but can easily be expanded.  
- Ideal for beginners learning C++ fundamentals.  
- This project demonstrates logic building & user interaction.
